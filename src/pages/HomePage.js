        The Fur Baby Cafe is located in Minneapolis, MN. The business is
        composed of: the coffee shop and the fur lounge. The coffee shop is
        similar to other small coffee shops, providing a comfortable and cozy
        environment. We serve organic and Fair Trade Certified coffee and tea
        alongside baked goods from local businesses. Come by and work, study,
        hang out in our cozy cafe. Our coffee is some of the best in town! The
        separate fur lounge area is where Fur Baby Cafe offers its unique
        experience that has never been seen before in Minneapolis or Seattle. We
        foster up to 20 rescue fur babies at any given time for you to come
        visit with and love! All fur babies are available for adoption through
        local rescues. There is a cover fee to visit the fur babies. This helps
        us provide care, food, and housing for them while they stay at the cafe.
        Visiting just for coffee helps support our rescue cats as much as
        visiting with them does! Appointments are not required to visit the cafe
        but if you want to guarantee your time with the cats we suggest making
        one. We sell any spaces still available in the lounge in store on a
        first come, first served basis.{" "}
